# Introduction to FlorisBoard

Welcome to the FlorisBoard documentation! This guide aims to help you understand, build, and potentially extend FlorisBoard, an open-source keyboard for Android.

FlorisBoard is built with a focus on privacy, modern design, and extensibility. It leverages cutting-edge Android development technologies, including Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and a modular architecture.

## What is FlorisBoard?

FlorisBoard is an Input Method Editor (IME) for Android devices. An IME is a user component that enables users to input text in various forms, such as on-screen keyboards for touch devices. FlorisBoard provides a rich set of features, including:

*   **Privacy-focused:** Designed with user privacy in mind.

*   **Extensible:** A modular architecture that allows for easy extension and customization.
*   **Spell Checker:** Integrated spell-checking capabilities.
*   **Clipboard Manager:** Advanced clipboard management features.

## Target Audience

This documentation is intended for:

*   **Users** who want to understand FlorisBoard's features and how to use it.
*   **Developers** who want to build FlorisBoard from source, contribute to its development, or use its architecture/components to create their own custom Android keyboard projects.

## Documentation Goal

The ultimate goal of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive resource that allows anyone to:

1.  **Replicate the FlorisBoard application** from source, detailing all necessary setup and build steps.
2.  **Understand the core architecture and API connections** between the keyboard's logic and the Android framework.
3.  **Start a new custom keyboard project in Android Studio from scratch**, leveraging the knowledge and patterns used in FlorisBoard.

Let's begin by setting up your development environment and getting FlorisBoard running on your device or emulator.
